To make students understand the principles and applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technologies; to teach students the fundamental concepts of RL, decision-making under uncertainty, policy/value function approximation, and learning-based control frameworks; and to develop the ability to design, train, and evaluate RL-based UAV control systems through simulation environments, sensor-driven feedback, autonomous mission planning, and real-world deployment considerations.
