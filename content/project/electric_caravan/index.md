The electric offroad caravan is a research and development project of Crawler. 

At the same time, I have done my PhD work in terms of transferring the ESP used in vehicles to caravans.

Instability modes in vehicle-caravan systems reveal the necessity of active chassis
control methods in these systems. In this study, a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is
developed to provide yaw stabilisation of the vehicle-self-propelled caravan system.
The effectiveness of the developed controller is demonstrated by both simulation
study and field tests. Simulation tests is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink and
CarSim environments. After the simulation studies is completed, the developed controller is embedded in the caravan electronic control unit. A self-propelled electric
towed off-road caravan is used in field tests. The developed controller is shown that
it performs yaw stabilisation effectively in field tests.
