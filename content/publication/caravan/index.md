abstract: As the population increases, is more and more increasing the number of vehicles in cities. The increasing number of vehicle make traffic management complicated. Difficult traffic management leads to more fuel consumption, CO2 and other harmful emissions. Therefore, real-time optimization of traffic lights (signaling) used in traffic management can make traffic management more efficient. In this study, green light time is optimized by estimating the number of vehicles in an intersection with signal lights in Konya city center through artificial neural network. The results are evaluated with different performance criteria and it has been shown that the developed estimation model can be successfully used to optimize the green light durations.
