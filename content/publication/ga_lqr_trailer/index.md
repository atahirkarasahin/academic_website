abstract: The necessity of active chassis control methods that can cope with the three typical unstable motion modes found in vehicle-trailer systems has emerged. Although there are studies aimed at preventing these instability situations mechanically, they cannot guarantee lateral stability. Active trailer braking system (ATBS) is used to solve this problem. In this study, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to be developed for the car-trailer system. The parameters of LQR are determined using the genetic algorithm (GA). The controller is developed in MATLAB/Simulink and experimentally validated in CarSim. It has been observed that the parameters to be determined by the genetic algorithm give better results than the parameters found by the trial-and-error method.
