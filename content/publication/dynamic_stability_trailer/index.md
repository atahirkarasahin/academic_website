abstract: In this study, parameters affecting stability in vehicle-caravan systems are investigated. In an example vehicle-caravan system, the location of the center of gravity and the effects of the speed of the vehicle-caravan system are evaluated. In order to examine the effects of the specified parameters, a double lane change maneuver has been carried out at certain speeds. The vehicle-caravan system is modeled with three degrees of freedom. The resulting system model is transferred to the MATLAB/Simulink environment and various experiments is implemented. Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller has been developed for the lateral stability of the vehicle-caravan system. In addition, system behavior is observed when the controller is active and passive. The effects of relocating the center of gravity and the controller's active or passive system dynamics are shown in the simulation environment. It has been shown that using an active controller for lateral stability in the vehicle-caravan system and having the center of gravity in the right place provides an improvement in system dynamics.
