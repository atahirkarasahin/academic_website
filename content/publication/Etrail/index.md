abstract: Instability modes in vehicle-caravan systems reveal the necessity of active chassis control methods in these systems. In this study, a fuzzy logic controller FLC is developed to provide yaw stabilization of the vehicle-self-propelled caravan system. The effectiveness of the developed controller is demonstrated by both simulation study and field tests. Simulation tests is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim environments. After the simulation studies is completed, the developed controller is embedded in the caravan electronic control unit. A self-propelled electric towed off-road caravan is used in field tests. The developed controller is shown that it performs yaw stabilization effectively in field tests.
