abstract: Parallel to population growth, the number of vehicles in cities is also increasing. The vehicle increase makes traffic management difficult. This situation leads to higher fuel consumption and emissions of CO2 and similar harmful emissions. Therefore, real-time optimization of traffic lights i.e. signalization can make traffic management more efficient. In this study, the duration of the signals at an intersection where the signal light in the center of Konya/Turkey is optimized by multi-objective optimization algorithms using optimum-cycle-length and average-delay-time as objectives. Three state-of-the-art algorithms are applied to this problem, which are named as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGAII), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2) and Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA). The dataset is obtained from Konya Metropolitan Municipality Transportation Traffic Planning Branch Directorate. The experimental results show that the optimum-cycle-time at signalized intersections can be determined by multi-objective optimization algorithms.
